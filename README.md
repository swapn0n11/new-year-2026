# New Year Landing Page ✨

A minimal, single-page New Year landing built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Designed to feel calm, futuristic, and intentional—like that quiet moment right when the year resets. Subtle animations, clean typography, and a dark aesthetic keep the focus on simplicity and mood rather than noise.

No frameworks, no heavy libraries, and no unnecessary fluff. Just lightweight, performance-first code with small interactions and motion that respect accessibility and modern web standards.
